                    storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low
                    income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during
                    weekends. He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma</li>

                    asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and
                    the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma’s old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him
                    I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did
                    well in my cricket"</li>
                <li>3) Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and
                    promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield
                    school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener</li>
